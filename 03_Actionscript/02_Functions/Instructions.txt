Goal: Learn how to call a function with a parameter

Instruction: You can define a function like this: 

	public function myFunction():void
	{
		label.text = "hello"
	}
	
	You can call it like this: myFunction()
	
	Instead, you can add a parameter, meaning you give it an instruction, and it can use the instruction to do different
 things. 

	public function myFunction(message:String):void
	{
		label.text = message;
	}
	
	you can call it like this; myFunction("hello");

Assignment: Make 3 buttons that size the width of something to three different values by calling the same function
