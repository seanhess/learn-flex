Use the Language Reference to figure out how to change the button font size to 24, and the height of the button to 300 pixels. (FlexBuilder -> Help -> Find in Language Reference)

Tip: remember to "show inherited properties" if you can't find what you're looking for

Experiment: Change some other stuff on the button.
